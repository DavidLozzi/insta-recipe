I cannot wait any longer. I'm so ready for soup season.

00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,179
This Mexican street corn,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,650
white chicken chili was my favorite new recipe that I tried last year.

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,310
So excited to make this on Sundays while football is playing in the background.

4
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,090
This is a soup.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,510
You're gonna have to make more than once once everything's simmered together.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,549
Add the toppings.

7
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,870
I love to add cheeses, bacon, avocado, tortilla chips and lime wedges.
